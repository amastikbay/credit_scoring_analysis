# Borrower reliability study


The customer is the bank's credit department. 

It is necessary to understand whether the client's marital status and number of children affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank is statistics on the solvency of clients.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank.

## Task

 - Is there a relationship between the number of children and loan repayment on time?

 - Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?

 - Is there a relationship between income level and loan repayment on time?

 - How do different loan purposes affect its repayment on time?
